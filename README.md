# 🧠 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge!  
This repository contains my daily progress, solutions, and optimizations for LeetCode problems — focused on data structures, algorithms, and clean coding practices.

## 🚀 Objective

To refresh, polish, and master problem-solving skills through a consistent 100-day challenge — solving LeetCode problems daily with time-tracking, complexity analysis, and strict self-assessment scoring.

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)
- Improve problem-solving speed, clarity, and optimization skills
- Prepare for top-tier product-based interviews (₹50 LPA+ or $100K+ roles)

## 📌 Challenge Rules

- Work solo, no AI/code reference unless debugging
- Track time taken per problem
- Log problem ID, time, difficulty, complexity
- Use GitHub repo to commit each day’s progress
- Update README and score log regularly
