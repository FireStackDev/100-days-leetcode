# 🧠 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge!  
This repository contains my daily progress, solutions, and optimizations for LeetCode problems — focused on data structures, algorithms, and clean coding practices.

## 🚀 Objective

To refresh, polish, and master problem-solving skills through a consistent 100-day challenge — solving LeetCode problems daily with time-tracking, complexity analysis, and strict self-assessment scoring.

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)
- Improve problem-solving speed, clarity, and optimization skills
- Prepare for top-tier product-based interviews (₹50 LPA+ or $100K+ roles)

## 📂 Daily Progress

- [Day 1](./DAY%201/) — Challenge started: Sliding Window, Linked List, Greedy, and DP  
- [Day 2](./DAY%202/) — Solved 4 problems + 2 optimisations (O(1) tweaks)  
- [Day 3](./DAY%203/) — Classic problems + cleanups: Valid Parentheses, LCP  
- [Day 4](./DAY%204/) — Spent more time on optimisations; explored heap/bucket sort  
- [Day 5](./DAY%205/) — Two-pointers, Linked Lists, Subsequence math — 5 problems in total  


> ✅ Update this list daily as new folders are added.

## 📊 Scoring Rules (Strict Mode)

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Easy problem solved solo within 25 minutes | +10 |
| ✅ Medium problem solved solo within 45 minutes | +25 |
| ✅ Hard problem solved solo within 90 minutes | +60 |
| ✨ Optimised Big-O complexity after accepted solution | +15 |
| 🧠 Wrote a ≤150-word pattern cheat-sheet | +10 |
| 🎙️ Taught back the solution clearly (≤ 3 min explanation) | +10 |
| ⌛ Solved after 1.5× max time | 50% points |
| ⌛ Solved between time cap and 1.5× cap | 75% points |

## 📌 Challenge Rules

- Work solo, no AI/code reference unless debugging
- Track time taken per problem
- Log problem ID, time, difficulty, complexity
- Use GitHub repo to commit each day’s progress
- Update README and score log regularly
