# 🧠 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge!  
This repository contains my daily progress, solutions, and optimizations for LeetCode problems — focused on data structures, algorithms, and clean coding practices.

## 🚀 Objective

To refresh, polish, and master problem-solving skills through a consistent 100-day challenge — solving LeetCode problems daily with time-tracking, complexity analysis, and strict self-assessment scoring.

My long-term goal is to crack high-paying tech roles (₹50+ LPA / $100K+), and this repo is a part of that journey.

- ✨ Optimised Big-O complexity → +15 pts  
- ✍️ Wrote pattern/cheat-sheet (≤ 150 words) → +10 pts  
- 📢 Taught back a solution (≤ 3 min explanation) → +10 pts  
- 🟥 Missed day without reason → −15 pts  
- 🧪 Copied code without understanding → −25 pts
